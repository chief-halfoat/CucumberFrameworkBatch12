Gherkin Language
    Given - pre-condition
    When - actions we need to perform
    And - supporting tag
    Then - expected results

Recap
*****
What is a framework?
--an organized structure of folders and packages which allows us to write clean and maintainable code

build management tool
--maven

pom.xml is the main configuration file in a maven project

main - used to write the code for development
test - used to write the code for testing the application
    --java
        --for tech/coding
    --resources
        --for non-technical/non-coding we use resources

cucumber supports BDD(Behavior Driven Development)
    --uses gherkin language(plain english) to write the scenarios

Scenario
    --it is a test case
    Given -- pre-condition
    When -- actions
    And -- supporting tag
    Then -- expected results

        When User enters valid employee name

Recap -

We use feature file to write our scenarios
    ex - search employee by id
         search employee by name

In feature file we write scenarios using gherkin language
    --Given/When/And/Then/Scenario/Feature
After feature file, we need to create step definitions
